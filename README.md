# CsGo-SkinMaker
Make csgo skins with this app.
This is a program that lets you make skins for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

To use this program, you'll need:

- A copy of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

- The Steam Workshop SDK"you can get it from this app"

Once you have all of that, you can open up the CSGO Skin Maker program and start creating your own skins!

There are a few things to keep in mind when making skins:

- Make sure the dimensions of your skin are 512x512 pixels.

- Make sure the skin is saved as a .png file.

- Make sure the file name of your skin ends in '.png' (for example, 'my_skin.png').

Once you've created your skin, you can upload it to the Steam Workshop by following the instructions here:
